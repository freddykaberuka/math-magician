        Without mathematics, there is nothing you can do.
        Everything around you is mathematics. Everything around you is numbers.
        <span>— Katherine Johnson, African-American mathematician</span>

        Mathematics as an expression of the human mind
        reflects the active will, the contemplative reason,
        and the desire for
        aesthetic perfection. Its basic elements are logic and
        intuition, analysis and construction, generality and individuality.
        <span>— Richard Courant, German-American mathematician</span>
      </p>

        As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are
        not certain, and as far as they are certain, they do not refer
        to reality.
        <span>— Albert Einstein</span>

        Mathematics are the result of mysterious powers which no
        one understands, and which the unconscious recognition of
        beauty must play an important part. Out of an infinity of designs a
        mathematician chooses one pattern for beauty’s sake and pulls it down to earth.
        <span>— Marston Morse, American mathematician</span>
